  HelpDesk for OS/2 is a project of OS/2 VOICE (www.os2voice.org).
  It provides a simple and secure remote control package that lets
  you view and modify a client's OS/2 system on demand using VNC
  over SSH. It is pre-configured and self-contained - no additional
  configuration or software other than InfoZip's zip/unzip is required.

  Using HelpDesk
_______________________________________________________________________________

  HelpDesk requires no setup or configuration and is ready to use as-is.
  Everything you need is located in the top-level 'helpdesk' directory.

  Note: to act as a HelpDesk host, you may have to configure your router.
  See "Port Forwarding" below.


  newClient.exe
  -------------
  When someone needs your assistance, run this to build 'HelpDesk.exe',
  a personalized HelpDesk Client package with a unique security key.

  Fill in the client's name, your name, and your IP address or domain name.
  All 3 will be shown to the client. If needed, press 'Get My IP' to fetch
  your current address. To pre-fill these fields, pass them as parameters
  to newClient from a program object or batch file:
    newClient.exe [clientName | '*'] [yourName | '*'] [yourIP]

  When done, press 'Create package'. A new copy of 'HelpDesk.exe' will
  be created in the top-level directory. Attach it to an email (as-is,
  not zipped). Instruct the client to detach the file, put it anywhere,
  then doubleclick on it at the agreed-upon time.

  Note: many email providers will refuse to deliver an email that has a
  '.exe' attached (regardless of whether it is zipped). We suggest you
  rename the file as 'HelpDesk.exq' before sending it, then have your
  client restore the correct extension before running it.


  runHelpDesk.cmd
  ---------------
  When the time comes to connect with the client, run this file.
  It will start the HelpDesk Daemon and wait for an incoming connection.
  Note: the daemon won't start until you've built your first package.

  After the user connects, VNC Viewer will popup a connection dialog.
  Accept the connection then enter the password (always "helpdesk").

  A window displaying the client's screen will appear. Use it to control
  the client's system in any way that VNC permits. When you close this
  window, the client's HelpDesk session will terminate.


  HelpDesk.exe
  ------------
  This is the HelpDesk Client package for a specific user - do not send
  it to anyone else. After you've sent it, you can delete your copy.

  When the client runs HelpDesk.exe, he is greeted by an introductory
  dialog that identifies both you and him by name. If he chooses to
  connect, a console window named "HelpDesk Session" appears showing
  the connection status. Upon connecting to your system, a "Welcome to
  HelpDesk" banner will be displayed.

  Nothing more is displayed to the client until you close VNC Viewer
  and end the session. HelpDesk then kills the client's copy of PMVNC,
  deletes all temporary files, and advises that the session has ended.

  If the user needs to terminate the session prematurely (e.g. unable
  to connect), he can press Ctrl-Break to have HelpDesk do an orderly
  shutdown, the same as if the session had ended normally.

  Connection Issues
_______________________________________________________________________________

  Host IP Address
  ---------------
  By default, HelpDesk.exe tries to connect to the IP address entered
  when you built it. If your IP changes, you can easily override that
  default without having to build a new package.

  In a text editor, create a new file named 'helpdesk.ip' and enter
  your current address or domain name. Email this to the client and
  instruct him to put the file in the same directory as 'helpdesk.exe'.


  Port Forwarding
  ---------------
  If the system that hosts HelpDesk is connected to a router, you will
  probably have to enable Port Forwarding for Port 22. This instructs
  your router to send all incoming traffic for Port 22 (i.e. SSH connect
  requests from HelpDesk clients) to the machine that is running the
  HelpDesk Daemon. Most routers provide a web interface to set this up.

  To test whether this is configured correctly, create a HelpDesk Client
  package using your current address. Run it, then press 'Connect'.
  If the HelpDesk Daemon is running, you should get VNC Viewer's popup;
  otherwise, you should see "Connection refused" in the client's
  HelpDesk Session window. Any other result -including a security alert-
  indicates Port Forwarding is not set up properly.


  Alternate Ports
  ---------------
  Hosts that already run an SSH server on Port 22 may want to configure
  HelpDesk to use another port. If you make this change for the host,
  you must set up every Client package to use this port as well.

  * Host-side: open 'runHelpDesk.cmd' in an editor. Toward the top is
    a line where you can set the port number. The Daemon can monitor
    multiple ports - separate each number with a space.
    e.g. "portNbr = 22 2222"

  * Client-side: when running 'newClient.exe', fill in your IP address
    or domain name as always, then append a colon and the port number.
    e.g. "192.168.255.101:2222" or "myname.dyndns.org:2222"

  Note: using an alternate port may enable connections from clients who
  are behind a firewall that blocks port 22. Try using the port for a
  well-known service such as http (80) or some flavor of email that is
  less likely to be blocked. After choosing a port, modify 'runHelpDesk'
  to monitor both port 22 and the alternate port (as described above).

  Security
_______________________________________________________________________________

  Host Security Key
  -----------------
  The host's private/public RSA keys are created the first time you
  build a client package. 'helpdesk\host\ssh_host_rsa_key' holds the
  private key; 'helpdesk\client\knwnhost' contains the public key.

  Your host keys should be protected and should never change. If they
  do, all client packages created with those keys will become unusable.
  To prevent this, HelpDesk backs-up your keys in 'helpdesk\save'.
  When you install a new version of HelpDesk, copy your existing 'save'
  directory to the new installation to continue using the same keys.


  Client Security Keys
  --------------------
  Each client package contains a unique private security key. The public
  key for that package is appended to 'helpdesk\host\authorized_keys'.
  Your security as a HelpDesk host depends upon this file.

  Each line in the file contains these components:

  * command="vncview 127.0.0.1:7777(<client's name>)",no-pty
    This is the key to your security. It ensures that the only thing
    a client connecting with this key can do is start VNC Viewer.
    In addition, the client is denied a terminal to prevent hacking
    if the client package is used maliciously. DO NOT CHANGE THIS!

  * ssh-rsa [followed by 713 characters ending with "= "]
    The client's public key - its presence here allows him to connect.

  * [client's name] [date] [your IP]
    Starting around column 770 is a comment area where HelpDesk stores
    the client's name, the date the key was created, and the IP address
    you used when you created the package. HelpDesk doesn't use this info
    but puts it here for your use.

  To temporarily disable a client package, use '#' to comment-out its line.
  To permanently disable a client package, delete its line.


  etc\passwd
  ----------
  The file 'helpdesk\host\etc\passwd' is recreated with current system
  info every time you run the HelpDesk Daemon ('runHelpDesk.cmd').
  Do not save or back-up this file.

  the need for any configuration or additional software. As such, the need
  for support should be minimal. However, if the need arises, you can write
